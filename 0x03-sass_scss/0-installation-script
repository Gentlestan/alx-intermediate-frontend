1. inside the existing repository "alx-intermediate-frontend".
2. I created the directory "0x03-sass_scss".
3. Opened VS Code integrated terminal.
4. Installed Sass using npm with:
   npm install sass
   (Note: the command npm install sass -v 3.7.4 defaults to the latest version since 3.7.4 does not exist in the "sass" package).
5. Verified installation with:
   npx sass --version
   Output: 1.92.1 compiled with dart2js 3.9.2
